I am a junior analyst working on the marketing analysis team at
Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for
women. As a data analyst, I have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat's products: Bellabeat app and analyze smart device fitness
data to gain insights into how customers use their smart devices.The
insights gained from my analysis will help guide Bellabeat's marketing
strategy. I will present my findings and recommendations to Bellabeat
executive team.

**About the company**

Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that
manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as
an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and
inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep,
stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women
with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded
in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a
tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened
offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat
products became available through a growing number of online retailers
in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The
company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio,
out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital
marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search,
maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently
engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on
Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support
campaigns around key marketing dates. Sršen knows that an analysis of
Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for
growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a
Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain
insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then,
using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for
how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

# **Prepare phase**

**Dataset used:** The data source used for our case study is FitBit
Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made
available through Mobius.

**Accessibility and privacy of data:**

Verifying the metadata of our dataset we can confirm it is open-source.
The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of
his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including
all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You
can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial
purposes, all without asking permission.

**Information about the dataset:** These datasets were generated by
respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between
03.12.2016--05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the
submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for
physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between
output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and
individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

**Data Organization:** There are 18 CSV documents made available for the
analysis. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked
by Fitbit. The data is considered long since each row is one time point
per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.Every user
has a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and
time.

**Data Integrity and Credibility:** Due to the limitation of size (30
users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a
sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the
population as a whole. Another problem we would encounter is that the
dataset is not current and also the time limitation of the survey (2
months long). That is why we will give our case study an operational
approach.

# **process phase**

I used R for my analysis because this dataset is a big data and R is
accessible, R gives me the opportunity to create data visualization to
share my findings and recommendations with stakeholders.

**Setting up my R environments**

-   tidyverse
-   here
-   lubridate
-   janitor
-   skimr

```{r}
# setting up my R environment

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

**Importing dataset**

```{r}
daily_activity <- read.csv("daily_activity.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv("daily_sleep.csv")
hourly_calories <- read.csv("hourly_calories.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read.csv("hourly_intensities.csv")
hourly_steps <- read.csv("hourly_steps.csv")
weight_log <- read.csv("weight_log.csv")
```
