I am a junior analyst working on the marketing analysis team at
Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for
women. As a data analyst, I have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat's products: Bellabeat app and analyze smart device fitness
data to gain insights into how customers use their smart devices.The
insights gained from my analysis will help guide Bellabeat's marketing
strategy. I will present my findings and recommendations to Bellabeat
executive team.

**About the company**

Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that
manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as
an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and
inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep,
stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women
with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded
in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a
tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened
offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat
products became available through a growing number of online retailers
in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The
company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio,
out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital
marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search,
maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently
engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on
Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support
campaigns around key marketing dates. Sršen knows that an analysis of
Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for
growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a
Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain
insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then,
using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for
how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

# **Prepare phase**

**Dataset used:** The data source used for our case study is FitBit
Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made
available through Mobius.

**Accessibility and privacy of data:**

Verifying the metadata of our dataset we can confirm it is open-source.
The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of
his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including
all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You
can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial
purposes, all without asking permission.

**Information about the dataset:** These datasets were generated by
respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between
03.12.2016--05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the
submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for
physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between
output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and
individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

**Data Organization:** There are 18 CSV documents made available for the
analysis. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked
by Fitbit. The data is considered long since each row is one time point
per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.Every user
has a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and
time.

**Data Integrity and Credibility:** Due to the limitation of size (30
users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a
sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the
population as a whole. Another problem we would encounter is that the
dataset is not current and also the time limitation of the survey (2
months long). That is why we will give our case study an operational
approach.

# **process phase**

I used R for my analysis because this dataset is a big data and R is
accessible, R gives me the opportunity to create data visualization to
share my findings and recommendations with stakeholders.

**Setting up my R environments**

-   tidyverse
-   here
-   lubridate
-   janitor
-   skimr

```{r}
# setting up my R environment

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

**Importing dataset**

```{r}
daily_activity <- read.csv("daily_activity.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv("daily_sleep.csv")
hourly_calories <- read.csv("hourly_calories.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read.csv("hourly_intensities.csv")
hourly_steps <- read.csv("hourly_steps.csv")
weight_log <- read.csv("weight_log.csv")
```

**Data preview**

print("Daily Activity") head(daily_activity)

print("Day Sleep") head(daily_sleep)

print("Hourly Calories") head(hourly_calories)

print("Hourly Intensities") head(hourly_intensities)

print("Hourly Steps") head(hourly_Steps)

print("Weight Log") head(weight_log)

```{r}
print("Daily Activity")
head(daily_activity)
```

**Check the data structure using str()**

str(daily_activity)

str(daily_sleep)

str(hourly_calories)

str(hourly_intensities)

str(hourly_steps)

str(weight_log)

```{r}
str(daily_sleep)
```

**Format and clean dataframes** I've familiarized myself with the data
set.I'll check for numbers of inconsistencies and errors,and check the
numbers of unique users per dataframe before cleaning.

unique(daily_activity\$Id)

unique(daily_sleep\$Id)

unique(hourly_calories\$Id)

unique(hourly_intensities\$Id)

unique(hourly_steps\$Id)

unique(weight_log\$Id)

```{r}
# unique users
unique(daily_activity$Id)
```

All data sets have 33 participants each except the daily_sleep and
weight data set which has 24 and 8 participants respectively. The weight
log dataset has 8 participants which is not a sufficient amount to use
for the analysis.

**Check for duplicates** sum(duplicated(daily_activity))

sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))

sum(duplicated(hourly_calories))

sum(duplicated(hourly_intensities))

sum(duplicated(hourly_steps))

```{r}
# checking for duplicates

sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
```

**Remove duplicates and missing values**

daily_activity \<- daily_activity %\>% distinct() %\>% drop_na()

daily_sleep \<- daily_sleep %\>% distinct() %\>% drop_na()

hourly_calories \<- hourly_calories %\>% distinct() %\>% drop_na()

hourly_intensities \<- hourly_intensities %\>% distinct() %\>% drop_na()

hourly_steps \<- hourly_steps %\>% distinct() %\>% drop_na() 


**Clean and rename columns**

clean_names(daily_activity)
daily_activity <- rename_with(daily_activity, tolower)

clean_names(daily_sleep)
daily_sleep <- rename_with(daily_sleep, tolower)

clean_names(daily_steps)
daily_steps <- rename_with(daily_steps, tolower)

clean_names(hourly_calories)
hourly_calories <- rename_with(hourly_calories, tolower)

clean_names(hourly_intensities)
hourly_intensities <- rename_with(hourly_intensities, tolower)

clean_names(hourly_steps)
hourly_steps <- rename_with(hourly_steps, tolower)


```{r Rename Table, include=FALSE}

# Clean and rename column names in daily_activity
clean_names(daily_activity)
daily_activity <- rename_with(daily_activity, tolower)

# Summary statistics for daily_activity
summary_daily_activity <- summary(daily_activity)
print(summary_daily_activity)

# Clean and rename column names in daily_sleep
clean_names(daily_sleep)

# Summary statistics for daily_sleep
summary_daily_sleep <- summary(daily_sleep)
print(summary_daily_sleep)

# Clean and rename column names in hourly_calories
clean_names(hourly_calories)
hourly_calories <- rename_with(hourly_calories, tolower)

# Summary statistics for hourly_calories
summary_hourly_calories <- summary(hourly_calories)
print(summary_hourly_calories)

# Clean and rename column names in hourly_intensities
clean_names(hourly_intensities)
hourly_intensities <- rename_with(hourly_intensities, tolower)

# Summary statistics for hourly_intensities
summary_hourly_intensities <- summary(hourly_intensities)
print(summary_hourly_intensities)

# Clean and rename column names in hourly_steps
clean_names(hourly_steps)
hourly_steps <- rename_with(hourly_steps, tolower)

# Summary statistics for hourly_steps
summary_hourly_steps <- summary(hourly_steps)
print(summary_hourly_steps)
```



**Date and Time column**

daily_activity \<- daily_activity %\>% rename(date = activitydate) %\>%
mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))

daily_sleep \<- daily_sleep %\>% rename(date = sleepday) %\>%
mutate(date = as.Date(date))

hourly_calories \<- hourly_calories %\>% rename(date_time =
activityhour) %\>% mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format
="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))

hourly_intensities \<- hourly_intensities %\>% rename(date_time =
activityhour) %\>% mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format
="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))

hourly_steps\<- hourly_steps %\>% rename(date_time = activityhour) %\>%
mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"
, tz=Sys.timezone()))


```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  rename(date = activitydate) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
  
  daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  rename(date = sleepday) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

hourly_calories <- hourly_calories %>% 
  rename(date_time = activityhour) %>% 
  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))

hourly_intensities <- hourly_intensities %>% 
  rename(date_time = activityhour) %>% 
  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))
  
  hourly_steps<- hourly_steps %>% 
  rename(date_time = activityhour) %>% 
  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))
```



**4.6.4 Merging the data sets**

```{r}
# daily_activity_sleep <- merge(daily_activity, daily_sleep, by = "id")
```

```{r}
daily_activity_sleep <- merge(daily_activity, daily_sleep, by = "id")
```


# **Analyze and Share phases** 

Analyzing trends of the users of FitBit to
determine how my insights can drive business in BellaBeat's marketing
strategy.

**Summarize and explore each data set**

```{r}
daily_activity %>%  
  select(totalsteps,
         totaldistance,
         sedentaryminutes, calories) %>%
  summary()
```

**Discoveries from the summary** - The Average total steps is 7638 in a
day. The daily recommended amount of steps to be taken per day is 7500

-   Sedentary minutes on an average is 991(\~17 hours). This should be
    minimized.

-   Majority of the participants are light users.

-   Participants sleep for an average of 419 minutes (\~7 hours).

-   A total of 97 calories is burned per hour on a average.

**Actual Steps taken and Calories burned** I am making a visualization
to see if there's a correlation between steps taken and the amount of
calories burned.

```{r}
ggplot(data = daily_activity, aes(x = totalsteps, y = calories)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title ="Total Steps vs. Calories")
```

There is a correlation between total steps taken and the amount of
calories burned.


**Steps per weekday**

```{r}
 weekday_steps <- daily_activity %>%
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(date))

weekday_steps$weekday <- ordered(weekday_steps$weekday, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",
                                                                   "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

weekday_steps <- weekday_steps %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarize(daily_steps = mean(totalsteps))

head(weekday_steps)
```

Visualize steps per weekday

```{r}
ggplot(weekday_steps, aes(weekday, daily_steps)) +
  geom_col(fill ="#008080" ) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 7500) +
  labs(title = "Daily steps per weekday", x= "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

```

**Sleep per weekday** To know what day of the week users sleep the most

```{r}
weekday_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(date))
weekday_sleep$weekday <-ordered(weekday_sleep$weekday, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",
                                                                "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

weekday_sleep <-weekday_sleep %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarize (daily_sleep = mean(totalminutesasleep))

head(weekday_sleep)
```

**Make visualization**
```{r}
ggplot(weekday_sleep, aes(weekday, daily_sleep)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#db7992") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 480) +
  labs(title = "Minutes asleep per weekday", x= "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```


**Discoveries from the above analysis**

-   In the graphs above we can deduce that users don't take the
    recommended amount of sleep of 8 hours

-   Users take recommended number of 7500 steps a day excepts for
    Sundays.

**Hourly intensities through the day**

Split the datetime column into date and time columns

```{r}
hourly_intensities <- hourly_intensities %>%
  separate(date_time, into = c("date", "time"), sep= " ") 

head(hourly_intensities)

hourly_intensities <- hourly_intensities %>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarise(mean_total_int = mean(totalintensity))

```

Make visualization of the hourly intensities data

```{r}
ggplot(data = hourly_intensities, aes(x = time, y = mean_total_int)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity", fill='purple') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title="Average Total Intensity vs. Time")

```

Discoveries after analyzing hourly intensities

-   People are more active between 5am and 10pm.

-   Most of the activity happens between 5 pm and 7 pm --- I suppose
    that when people are done with work for the day, they go to the gym
    or take a walk. We can use this period of time to remind and
    motivate users to go for a run or walk using the Bellabeat app.

**Hourly steps throughout the day**

Separating the datetime column into date and time column

```{r}
daily_activity_sleep <- daily_activity_sleep %>%
  na.omit() 

daily_counts <- table(daily_activity_sleep$id) 

active_users <- sum(daily_counts == 31) 
regular_users <- sum(daily_counts > 15) 
occasional_users <- sum(daily_counts < 16) 

# Print the results
cat("Number of active users:", active_users, "\n")
cat("Number of regular users:", regular_users, "\n")
cat("Number of occasional users:", occasional_users, "\n")
```


Create a percentage data frame to better visualize the results in the
graph

```{r}
total_users <- length(unique(daily_activity_sleep$id))
active_percentage <- (active_users / total_users) * 100
regular_percentage <- (regular_users / total_users) * 100
occasional_percentage <- (occasional_users / total_users) * 100

percentage_df <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Active Users", "Regular Users", "Occasional Users"),
  Percentage = c(active_percentage, regular_percentage, occasional_percentage)
)

```

Make a visualization of the smart device usage per user

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
percentage_df <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Active Users", "Regular Users", "Occasional Users"),
  Percentage = c(60, 25, 15)
)

# Create the visualization
ggplot(percentage_df, aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold")
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Percentage, "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#008080", "#d62d58", 'purple'),
    labels = c(
      "Active Users",
      "Regular Users",
      "Occasional Users"
    )
  ) +
  labs(title = "Daily Use of Smart Device", fill = "User Category")
```

From the above visualization we can deduce that:

-   60% of the users of our sample use their device frequently ---
    between 21 to 31 days.

-   25% are are occasional users (they use their device for 11 to 20
    days).

-   15% of our sample are regular user of their device.

\*\*6. ACT Phase (Conclusion)

Bellabeat companmy was created with a mission to empower women by
providing them with the data to discover more about their health and
habits.

I did an analysis on the average number of steps, hours of sleep and
calories burned.I also focused on the days which users are most active,
the time of the day with the most activity and went further to analyze
how the device was used by each user.

After analyzing the FitBit Fitness data, I will respond to the business
task of helping Bellabeat on its marketing stratergy based on my
results;

I would advice that for further analysis, we use tracking data from
Bellabeat's device.

The datasets used have a small sample and can be biased since we didn't
have any demographic details of users.

-   **Target audience**

Our main target are young and adult women who work full-time
jobs(according to hourly intensities data) and these women do some light
activity to stay healthy (according to the activity type analysis). I
would encourage to continue finding trends to be able to create a
marketing stragety focused on them and provide knowledge about
developing healthy habits.

That being said, these are my recommendations for Bellabeat company;

-   **Recommendation for the app**

-   **Daily notification on steps taken**

According to CDC taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51%
lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking
12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with
taking 4,000 steps. Bellabeat can encourage people to take at least 8
000 explaining the benefits for their health. Sending notifications
daily at different times will make users conscious of the number of
steps achieved so far and encourage them to meet the set target of 8000
steps according to CDC. The app can also educate users on the health
benefits of walking the daily recommended number of steps.

-   **Daily notification on sleep**

From the results of my analysis, I can see that users have less than the
recommended amount of sleep in a day. We can enable a feature on the app
that allows user set up a desired time to go to sleep and receive a
notification minutes before to prepare to sleep or set up an alarm to
sleep.

-   **Notification based on user needs**

If users want to lose weight, controlling daily calorie consumption is a
good idea.The Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie food to
such users.

-   **Reward system** We can create a reward system based on the level
    of activity on the app. The app could consist of stages to reach
    based on the amount of steps walked everyday. You need to maintain
    activity level for a period of time (maybe a month) to pass to the
    next level. For each level you would win certain amount of stars
    that would be converted into discount on other Bellabeat products.

-   **Recommendation for the online campaign** Make sure the online
    campaign portrays the Bellabeat app more than just a fitness
    activity app. It should be seen as a guide that empowers women to
    strike a balance in their personal and professional life and their
    health habits by educating and motivating them through daily app
    recommendations.
